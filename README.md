Add the [firebase-messaging-sw.js](https://github.com/BFMarks/IterableWebPush/blob/master/firebase-messaging-sw.js) file right next to the manifest.json file.

**Setup Project and Add Code**

### 2. Open the [Cloud Messaging](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/) tab of the Firebase console Settings pane and scroll to the Web configuration section.

3. In the Web Push certificates tab, click Generate Key Pair. The console displays a notice that the key pair was generated, and displays the public key string and date added.

The key pair is your Firebase webpush certificate.

4. [Add the github code](https://github.com/BFMarks/IterableWebPush/blob/master/IterableWebPush.html) to your HTML file in the <script> section

5. Change the credentials to your firebase credentials and Iterable credentials

6.  Add the [requestPermission() function](https://github.com/BFMarks/IterableWebPush/blob/00df3084d9912ed1d08b747dafbe591ee6dd9eb0/IterableWebPush.html#L170) to the place in your code that you want to trigger the permission popup.  Typically, itâ€™s right after signup once you have the user email.

7.  Add the users email to the email variable

8.  Call the [deleteToken() function](https://github.com/BFMarks/IterableWebPush/blob/00df3084d9912ed1d08b747dafbe591ee6dd9eb0/IterableWebPush.html#L187) when a user refreshes the page as this will acquire the latest token and re-update it to the Iterable server.  It is recommended to put this in periodically to ensure you have the most up-to-date browser token.

**NOTES:**

* **The webpush popup will not appear if the page is front and center.  It must be minimized or backgrounded.**

* **If the popup fails, Chrome may also need to be reset.**
